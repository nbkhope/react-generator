## Sublime Text 3 Snippets

Snippets for Sublime Text are also available!

Copy all the files inside the [sublime-snippets/](sublime-snippets/) directory into your own snippets directory. For Mac users, that would be `~/Users/$USER/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`.

```sh
cp sublime-snippets/* ~/Users/$USER/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User
```

See the table in the previous section for a listing of all the snippets available.
